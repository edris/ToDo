Project: Todo app for Codepath Android Bootcamp Pre-work

Notes:
	1. A Successfully built the initial Todo app with Add Item and Long Press delete
	2.  Edit Feature was giving me issues
		2a. I created a second activity with the multiline text and new button
		2b.	I couldn't get the Intent() to work properly in the MainActivity
	3. for adding new items I simply created a short press response to the list items in the MainActivity to display the biggest achievement I could.

I am very excited for this course. please give me some help in connecting my MainActivity to my EditItemActivity using Intent
